        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
      <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
      <li>Internal style sheet embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element</li>
      <li>External style sheet is preferred in most cases and allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, making design changes easier</li>
      <li>When we create an external CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file</li>
      <li>Share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. </li>
