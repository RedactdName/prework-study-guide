        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The head element is not visible to the user</li>
          <li>Meta elements describe structure of webpage</li>
          <li>The body element contains headers h1-h6 in sequential order to allow for accessibility for those using screen readers</li>
          <li>There are different names/titles/characterisers for each type of element added to webpage</li>
          <li>HTML has parent/child elements</li>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development</li>
          <li>Meta-related, content division and semantic are common element types used to divide and describe a page</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements to indicate the role of their content, as well as to give structure to the content of the webpage</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
      <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
      <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
      <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only</li>
      <li>Internal style sheet embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element</li>
      <li>External style sheet is preferred in most cases and allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, making design changes easier</li>
      <li>When we create an external CSS file, we need to link it to the HTML file</li>
      <li>Share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. </li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
     <ul>
       <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on </li>
       <li>git checkout -b branch name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
       <li>git checkout main takes you back to main from wherever you are in terminal</li>
       <li>git pull origin main pulls any changes that may have been made in main branch and should be done at the beginng of each session</li>
       <li>Repository is typically shorthanded to repo</li>
       <li>The command git add -A is used to commit all files in the working branch</li>
       <li>The -m flag is used to include descriptive messages of changes in the commit</li>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
     <ul>
      <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
      <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
      <li>Tool that takes a static HTML/CSS webpage and makes it interactive</li>
      <li>JavaScript is case sensitive, if you have a problem in your code, check the case</li>
      <li>JavaScript is read from top to bottom and order counts</li>
      <li>Using conditional statements allows us to interrupt control flow</li>
      <li>Variables: containers that store values, necessary to do anything interesting in programming</li>
      <li>Declare a variable with the var keyword, followed by the name you give to the variable</li>
      <li>A ; at the end of a line indicates where a statement ends. It is only required when you need to separate statements on a single line</li>
      <li>Boolean: A true/false value</li>
      <li>Strings: A sequence of text. Signified by enclosing in single or double quote marks</li>
      <li>Arrays: A structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference</li>
      <li>Being able to store a group of data in an array is a fundamental feature of JavaScript</li>
      <li>A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, etc</li>
      <li>For loops use the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array</li>
      <li>A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
      <li>You must call a function by name in order to execute it</li>
      <li>To declare a function, we use the function keyword and then give our function a unique name followed by parentheses. Then we add curly brackets {} that contain the code for the task we want to perform</li>
